Estimating epidemiological dynamics from cross sectional viral load distributions

Code for the multiple cross section (GP Prior) model is found [here](https://github.com/pargaw/pyCt/blob/main/Multi%20Cross%20Section/Gaussian%20Process%20Prior%20Model.ipynb)

Code for the single cross section (Exponential Growth) model is found [here](https://github.com/pargaw/pyCt/blob/main/Single%20Cross%20Section/%20Exponential%20Growth%20Model.ipynb)
